				<h5>Give me some background</h5>
				<p>XMPP is an open protocol for messaging and communication. It is standardized, developed, and implemented by the community and controlled by no entity or corporation. It has existed for over a decade, but it's now re-emerging from the darkness.</p>
				<p>It can finally replace all closed platforms that attempt to concentrate everyone's communication inside one of their walled gardens, and allow you to have absolute freedom in terms of app choice, functionality, and expandibility.</p>
				<p>In order to actually use XMPP, you need a server and a client [also sometimes known as an app these days]. You can find a client for all of your devices right now, they're already out and available, install just like any other that you alreayd know, and they're amazing. Look below for a list of our favourite ones!</p>
				<p>In terms of servers, however, traditionally it's been an absolute devastation. All of them out there are hard to set up, very hard to configure, and extremely hard to make actually functional and secure.</p>
				<p>Fortunately, all of that has now changed, thanks to <b>aenigma</b>. Deploy your fully functional and secure XMPP server today in about 15 minutes, and break free of proprietary and encumbered chat apps forever.</p>

				<h5>Is this for me?</h5>
				<p>Absolutely. If you chat and message with anyone, invest one fourth of one day of your life to definitively make the change and take all of your family and friends with you for the ride.</p>
